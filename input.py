# Kind of calculations to be performed. Set to either "download", "fit", "download_and_fit", "find_trading_rules" or "out_of_sample". "download" downloads the data from Yahoo Finance; "fit" fits the data to probability distributions (and eventually to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation), "download_and_fit" makes both; "find_trading_rules" calculates the optimal trading rules; "out_of_sample" calculates the profitability in specified periods.
calculation_mode =  "download_and_fit"

regime_switching = False # If True, regime switching a la Hamilton 1989 is applied to the mean reversion parameter E0. This makes the calculations much slower than if regime_switching=False, hence set it to True only if looking at the plot of the spread it is clear that there is a regime switching, which can be identified as a series having two clearly different levels. Note that if you set it to True, just norm and nct distributions for the residuals are possible. This affects both the calculations of searching the parameters of the distribution (E0, sigma, ...) AND the calculations of finding optimal trading rules.
#spread_type_for_regime_switching = "y_vs_x" # "x_vs_y" or "y_vs_x" # This variable sets how the Spread is defined. If it is "y_vs_x" then the Spread is log(Price_{label_y}) - gammaÂ·log(Price_{label_x}), where gamma is the slope of the Return_{label_y}-vs-Return_{label_x}. If it is "x_vs_y", then the prices and returns are swapped. Since fitting is slow in regime switching calculations, if regime_switching is set to True, then only y_vs_x or x_vs_y is analysed.

# The variable below indicates the type of trading that will be performed. Possibilities: "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_equation" (for pairs trading) or "single_product" (for single-product trading).
evolution_type = "Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_equation"

# Labels of the products whose time-series must be downloaded. Note that they are taken into account only if "download" is in calculation_mode; otherwise the starting point of the calculations is the stationarity file (in the Output directory).
# Each list_product_labels consists of 4 parts:
#  i)   The name of the set of products (e.g. US_banks; this is an arbitrary label);
#  ii)  The list of Yahoo Finance tickers of the stocks of cryptocurrencies whose pairs will be analysed;
#  iii) The list of the tickers risk factors (e.g. '^STOXX50E' for the EuroStoxx50) to be used in the calculation of
#       common trends to calculate the gamma to be used in the definition of the spread.
#  iv)  The name of the file which contains the risk-free_rate-vs-t data (located in the Time_series directory,
#       e.g. 'US_1Y_yields' or 'GER_1Y_yields', which can be manually downloaded from https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/germany-1-year-bond-yield-historical-data and https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/u.s.-1-year-bond-yield-historical-data).
#       THE RISK-FREE RATE MUST BE EXPRESSED IN % (e.g. 5.1 for 5.1%, not 0.051). This is optional, if omitted the risk-free rate
#       will be assumed to be 0 for every time, this is it will not be used in the calculation of the gamma which defines the spread.
