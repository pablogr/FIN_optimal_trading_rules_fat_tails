# FIN_optimal_trading_rules_fat_tails
This contains an easily usable code which calculates the optimal rules for pairs trading (profit-taking, stop-loss, maximum horizon) using fat-tailed distributions and mitigating backtest overfitting. See details on the calculation methods corresponding to this code in the paper 'The effect of fat tails on rules for optimal pairs trading' (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4518354), in its Supporting Information and in the tutorial (tutorial.pdf) that you can find in this repository.
